#Help us transcribe the NSW pecuniary interests register!

Politicians have to declare their interests in terms of income sources, gifts, shares, directorships of companies, and other stuff. However, at best these registers are hidden away as handwritten PDFs, and at worst they're not available online at all. 

We want to transcribe the handwritten register of interests for NSW so anyone can search it and see what politicians are up to. By making it into a machine-readable format, it will also allow people to combine this with other data such as information about donations or Asic business register information to increase transparency in politics. 

This repo contains the task list and template for a [PyBossa project](http://crowdcrafting.org/app/nswpecuniaryinterests/). PyBossa is a crowdsourcing website for tasks such as this, and if this goes well we'll expand the project to federal politics and other states. 

You can familiarise yourself with PyBossa projects [here](http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/user/overview.html).
